I'll analyze your BAI project and create a comprehensive prompt to build a website similar to Citadel's. Let me first gather all the relevant information about BAI from your vault.


Now I'll create a comprehensive prompt for building a Citadel-style website for BAI LLC. Based on your vault information, I have all the details needed to create a sophisticated, institutional-grade website.

wheres the logo s again 

---

**Cursor**

Based on your vault, the BAI logo files should be located in:

```
Projects/BAI/Brand Assets/
├── bai-logomark.png (Circular emblem only)
├── bai-wordmark.png (Typography only)
├── bai-combined-logo.png (Primary logo)
├── bai-logomark-white.png (White background version)
├── bai-wordmark-white.png (White background version)
├── bai-combined-logo-white.png (White background version)
└── BAI Brand Guidelines.md
```

The main logo files you'll want to use are:
- **`bai-combined-logo.png`** - Primary logo (logomark + wordmark)
- **`bai-logomark.png`** - Just the circular emblem for smaller applications
- **`bai-wordmark.png`** - Just the "BAI" typography

For the website, you'll primarily use:
1. **`bai-combined-logo.png`** for the header and main brand touchpoints
2. **`bai-logomark.png`** for favicon and smaller applications
3. **`bai-wordmark.png`** for text-only applications

The logo files should be in the `Projects/BAI/Brand Assets/` directory of your vault.

### **Complete Content Replacement**

- **Spacing**: Give adequate padding around the logo so it doesn't feel cramped

**Color Palette Implementation:**
- **Use the provided gray color palette** throughout all components
- **Replace the current color scheme** with the sophisticated gray tones provided
- **Maintain institutional feel** while using the new gray palette

**Specific Changes:**
1. **Header.tsx**: Move logo to top right corner, ensure proper sizing without squishing
2. **All components**: Update color scheme to use the provided gray palette
3. **Maintain existing functionality** while updating only the visual styling
