**PROJECT: BAI Website (baifunds.com) - Development Logging Rule**

**CONTEXT:** This is a React/TypeScript website for BAI Funds (Bai Awan Investments) hosted on GitHub Pages with custom domain baifunds.com.

**CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT ISSUES TO AVOID:**
- **MIME Type Error**: GitHub Pages serves JS files as `application/octet-stream` instead of `application/javascript`
- **Prevention**: Always use `target: 'es2020'` in vite.config.ts, avoid `es2015` or older targets
- **White Screen Issue**: Caused by JavaScript modules failing to load due to MIME type mismatch
- **Solution**: If MIME error occurs, rebuild with es2020 target and redeploy

**RULE:** Every time we complete a development session or make significant changes, you MUST:

1. **Update the development log** in `DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md` with:
   - Date and timestamp
   - What we accomplished
   - Technical changes made
   - Files modified
   - Any issues encountered and how they were resolved
   - Current project status
   - Next steps or goals

2. **Maintain project context** by keeping track of:
   - Overall project goals
   - Technical architecture decisions
   - SEO optimization progress
   - Deployment status
   - Known issues or limitations
   - **CRITICAL**: Always check vite.config.ts target is 'es2020' before deployment

3. **Format consistently** using clear sections, bullet points, and technical details

4. **Reference this log** at the start of each new session to maintain continuity

**GOAL:** Create a comprehensive, searchable development history that any developer (including future AI assistants) can reference to understand the project's evolution, decisions, and current state.
