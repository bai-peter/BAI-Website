### UI Update — Make feature cards fully opaque (2025-09-23)

- Changes:
  - Replaced translucent backgrounds (`/10`, `/20`) with solid brand fills for icon containers.
  - Removed `hover:bg-muted/20` from feature cards; set card surface to `bg-card` for opaque base.
  - Used white inner badge circles for contrast against solid brand squares.
- Files modified:
  - `src/components/Manifesto.tsx`
  - `src/components/Gap.tsx`
  - `src/components/Community.tsx`
- Result:
  - No bleed-through from background animation; cards are completely opaque.

### Layering Fix — Move pulse layer behind content (2025-09-23)

- Change:
  - Updated `.pulse-layer` z-index from 50 to 1 in `src/index.css` to ensure it renders behind all content and opaque cards.
- Result:
  - Eliminates background line bleed-through over feature cards while keeping animation visible.

### Layering Adjustment — Pulse above section bg but below cards (2025-09-23)

- Changes:
  - Set `.pulse-layer` to `z-index: 15` to sit above section backgrounds.
  - Removed `z-10` from Manifesto section/container to avoid covering pulse.
  - Elevated cards/tiles with `relative z-20` to ensure they sit above the pulse layer.
- Files modified:
  - `src/index.css`
  - `src/components/Manifesto.tsx`
  - `src/components/Gap.tsx`
  - `src/components/Community.tsx`
- Result:
  - Pulse lines render above background but do not bleed over cards.

### Performance Tweak — Limit concurrent background lines to 6 (2025-09-23)

- Change:
  - Reduced `maxConcurrentLines` from 10 to 6 in `src/components/BackgroundChart.tsx`.
- Result:
  - Lower visual density and GPU usage while keeping the effect visible.

### Content Update — Team role titles (2025-09-23)

- Changes:
  - Updated roles in `src/components/FoundersInSearch.tsx` to concise, technical titles:
    - Peter: Head of Investment Research
    - Muhammad: Head of Systems Engineering
    - Josephina: Head of Research Partnerships & Operations
    - Frank: Head of Capital Markets & Execution
- Result:
  - Titles are precise, investor-facing, and aligned with responsibilities.

- Changes:
  - Deleted spa-github-pages redirect script from `index.html` to prevent recursive `/dist` URL query loops.
  - Using manifest-based loader for production and Vite entry for dev.
- Files modified:
  - `index.html`

### Deployment — 2025-09-22

- Built with Vite (target es2020 per deployment rule) and pushed to `main`.
- Dev improvements:
  - Gated production redirect in `index.html` to avoid dev blank screen.
  - Added Vite dev entry script for local mount.
- UI changes included in this deploy:
  - Card background opacity increases; Core Systems cards fully opaque.
  - Team cards: single-open expansion, restored grid layout.
- Files touched in this deploy:
  - `index.html`
  - `src/components/FoundersInSearch.tsx`
  - `src/components/TechnologyPlatform.tsx`
  - `src/index.css`
- Issues:
  - Local blank screen due to redirect—resolved via environment gating and dev entry.
- Next:
  - Verify GitHub Pages serves updated assets without MIME issues.
  - Visual QA production.

- Make Core Systems cards fully opaque

- Changes:
  - Set global `.group.border.rounded-lg` background to fully opaque `bg-card`.
  - Updated Core Systems cards to use `bg-card` (no alpha) with solid hover.
- Files modified:
  - `src/index.css`
  - `src/components/TechnologyPlatform.tsx`

- Fix team card expansion to be per-card, not global

- Changes:
  - Replaced single `expandedCard` state with a `Set<number>` `expandedCards` to track multiple open cards independently.
  - Updated toggle logic and UI conditions accordingly.
- Files modified:
  - `src/components/FoundersInSearch.tsx`

- Adjust font sizing and contrast in Technology & Infrastructure → Core Systems cards

- Changes:
  - Increased title to `text-xl md:text-2xl`, body to `text-base md:text-lg` for readability.
  - Set base fill to `bg-card/90` with `hover:bg-card` for solid background and better contrast.
  - Kept borders consistent with `border border-border`.
- Files modified:
  - `src/components/TechnologyPlatform.tsx`

## 2025-09-22 — Improve card background opacity for readability

- Changes:
  - Increased default opacity for outlined cards so background within borders is less transparent and text is more readable.
  - Removed translucency on `.card-interactive` hover that previously reduced contrast.
- Technical details:
  - Edited `src/index.css`:
    - Removed `hover:bg-muted/20` from `.card-interactive`.
    - Added base fill for outlined group cards: `.group.border.rounded-lg { background-color: hsl(var(--card) / 0.9); }` and solid on hover.
- Files modified:
  - `src/index.css`
- Issues encountered:
  - None; Tailwind linter warnings (`@apply`, `@tailwind`) are expected and unchanged.
- Status:
  - Readability of card content increased without altering overall design language.
- Next steps:
  - Visual QA across light/dark modes and sections with busy backgrounds; tweak alpha if needed.
  - If any cards still lack contrast, consider adding `backdrop-blur` or stronger `bg-card` in those contexts.

## 2025-09-22

- Updated animated nodes to follow geometric grid globally and removed them from Hero to keep the video layer clean and unobstructed.
- Fixed scroll offset across `Index.tsx`, `Header.tsx`, and `Footer.tsx` to 120px to eliminate the video sliver when navigating to sections (e.g., "Our Approach").
- Normalized spacing util classes: reduced `section-spacing` and `content-spacing` for better balance; adjusted Hero internal spacing.
- Standardized typography scale (reduced h1–h3, paragraphs, and taglines) for institutional readability.
- Refined Team section layout: tightened stats spacing, compact card layout, consistent text sizes.
- Increased the About section logo size within "Key Metrics" (container to `w-28 h-28`, logo `w-20`).
- Verified Vite build target remains `es2020` for GitHub Pages MIME compatibility.
 - Converted section background layers (geometric patterns + nodes) to fixed-position so they remain stationary during scroll across all sections; disabled pointer events to avoid interaction issues.
 - Replaced geometric backgrounds and nodes with a fixed far-background SVG chart (`BackgroundChart.tsx`) that renders a randomized upward-biased line with a glowing pulse. Applied to all sections except Hero. Removed prior floating nodes CSS.
 - Restored visibility of randomized line animation by raising `.background-layer` stacking context (z-index from -10 to 0) while keeping `pointer-events: none` to avoid blocking interactions.
 - Added fixed `.pulse-layer` to render glowing heads above content; ensured hidden over Hero only.
 - Converted single line to multiple independently seeded lines with slower motion; smoothed volatility and reduced step rate; pulses now visibly lead the lines across sections including `#what-we-do`.
 - Replaced dot heads with neon leading segment; applied `mix-blend-mode: screen` and glow to ensure visibility on white sections without overpowering dark ones; ensured Hero sits above pulses (no overlay on video).
 - Added fade-out on completion and staggered spawning so new lines begin before previous complete; biased endpoints to land mid-to-top right for visually pleasing terminations.
 - Removed endpoint targeting; lines now wander randomly with upward bias, still fading out at completion and spawning successors before completion for continuous flow.
 - Slowed fade-out (opacity decays gently) and applied opacity to both trail and neon head so the entire line visibly fades.
 - Increased max concurrent lines to 10 with sequential, randomized cooldown spawns (no bursts); each line fades independently.
 - Header improvements: dynamic anchor offsets use actual header height; header z-index raised above pulse layer to keep logo/nav visible; section headings no longer hidden under header.
 - Switched brand palette to grayscale: updated CSS variables for primary/accent to neutral grays; adjusted animated line colors to grayscale neon/white; components inherit new scheme via Tailwind tokens.
- Deployed latest changes to GitHub Pages (main). Verified `vite.config.ts` target is `es2020` to avoid MIME issues. Expect propagation within a few minutes.
 - Refined anchor scrolling: both header nav and global links now subtract actual header height (with minimal extra spacing) to reduce excessive top gap when navigating to sections.
 - Increased global rounding: bumped `--radius` to 1rem and rounded cards/glass panels site-wide for softer edges.

Files modified:
- `src/components/Hero.tsx`
- `src/components/About.tsx`
- `src/components/FoundersInSearch.tsx`
- `src/components/Manifesto.tsx`
- `src/components/TechnologyPlatform.tsx`
- `src/components/Community.tsx`
- `src/pages/Index.tsx`
- `src/components/Header.tsx`
- `src/components/Footer.tsx`
- `src/index.css`

Issues addressed:
- Floating nodes appearing over video; moved off Hero.
- Section scroll landing offset showing video sliver; increased offset.
- Excessive spacing and oversized type leading to cramped/uneven layout.

Status:
- Local dev server running on http://localhost:8080/ with HMR.

Next steps:
- Fine-tune node path randomness along grid; consider multi-path variants.
- QA on multiple screen sizes; adjust offsets for mobile header height if needed.
- Prepare for deploy; confirm assets and favicon behavior post-build.

**Next Review**: 2025-01-26  
**Status**: 🚀 ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT 

### Session — 2025-09-23

- Summary:
  - Fixed background line bleed-through comprehensively. Kept cards opaque, removed section-wide masks, and finally placed the pulse layer behind all content for guaranteed occlusion.
  - Standardized feature cards to fully opaque across sections (Manifesto, Gap, TechnologyPlatform, Community, Team).
  - Introduced and later removed `.occlude-pulse` after testing; settled on simpler layering with opaque cards and pulse at lowest z.
  - Tightened footer spacing.
  - Limited concurrent background lines from 10 → 6.
  - Updated team roles to concise one-liners and enhanced bios with role responsibilities.

- Layering & Visuals:
  - Set `.pulse-layer` z-index to 0 (behind all content) in `src/index.css`.
  - Removed `.occlude-pulse` utility and all usages from grids/panels.
  - Kept per-card opacity via explicit `backgroundColor: hsl(var(--card))` and card classes.

- Opaque Feature Cards:
  - Manifesto: replaced translucent backgrounds; grid cards use solid brand icon squares; feature tiles `bg-card`.
  - Gap: strategies and infra tiles opaque; removed hover translucency.
  - TechnologyPlatform: capability cards and Core Systems tiles opaque; removed group translucency.
  - Community: contact card opaque.
  - Team: each card individually opaque; equalized heights; truncated long names/roles.

- Animated Background:
  - BackgroundChart: `mixBlendMode: normal`; maxConcurrentLines = 6.

- Content Updates:
  - Team titles: Head of Investments; Head of Systems Engineering; Head of Partnerships; Head of Capital Markets.
  - Team bios: appended clear responsibility sentences; preserved existing facts and tone.

- Spacing:
  - Footer: `py-8 md:py-12`, inner `pt-4 md:pt-6`.

- Files modified:
  - `src/index.css`
  - `src/components/Manifesto.tsx`
  - `src/components/Gap.tsx`
  - `src/components/TechnologyPlatform.tsx`
  - `src/components/Community.tsx`
  - `src/components/FoundersInSearch.tsx`
  - `src/components/BackgroundChart.tsx`
  - `src/components/Footer.tsx`
  - `src/components/About.tsx`

- Issues resolved:
  - Background line bleed-through over cards; fixed via layering and opacity.
  - Inconsistent card heights; fixed with layout tweaks and truncation.

- Team modal & logos:
  - Reworked team cards to open details in a centered modal (no downward expansion). Kept card name/title sizes unchanged.
  - Modal background set to white for clean logo rendering.
  - Added degree line under role; stacked school logos under portrait.
  - Mapped logos: Peter → Ivey; Muhammad → Waterloo; Josephina → Waterloo + Laurier; Frank → Huron. Normalized logo widths to match portrait (w-36, auto height).
  - Tightened modal typography spacing for name/role/degree; left-aligned descriptions; names/titles centered on cards.

- Metrics updates:
  - About → Key Metrics: Founded 2025, Trade win rate 93.3%, Avg return/trade +5.30%, Avg holding period 4 days.
  - Team → Metrics tiles: $13B+ AUM experience, 10 sectors worked (collective), 4 research publications (YTD), 3 universities represented.

- Deployment notes:
  - `vite.config.ts` target verified as 'es2020'.
  - Safe to deploy to GitHub Pages.

### Session — 2025-09-23 (Mobile QA and fixes)

- What we accomplished:
  - Ran dual dev instances for side‑by‑side desktop/mobile QA; stabilized on a single dev server at `http://localhost:5173/` due to Windows shell piping issues.
  - Verified Vite dev HMR availability via `/@vite/client` and resolved initial 404 by restarting server cleanly.
  - Implemented core mobile fixes across hero, header, grids, and typography.
- Technical changes:
  - `src/components/Hero.tsx`:
    - Replace `h-screen` with safe viewport unit `h-[100svh]` for mobile browsers.
    - Add `hero-hide-background` marker on hero section to ensure background layers stay hidden over the video.
    - Add `poster` and `preload="metadata"` to video for better mobile performance and fallback.
  - `src/index.css`:
    - Add `overflow-x-hidden` on `body` to prevent horizontal scroll on small screens.
  - `src/components/Header.tsx`:
    - Lock background scroll when mobile menu is open by toggling `overflow-hidden` on `<body>`.
  - `src/components/FoundersInSearch.tsx`:
    - Make grid 1‑col on xs, 2‑col on sm; reduce avatar sizes on small screens; adjust gaps and padding.
  - `src/components/About.tsx`:
    - Tighten metrics grid gaps on mobile and scale down numeric display sizes.
  - `src/components/TechnologyPlatform.tsx`:

  - `src/components/TechnologyPlatform.tsx`
  - `src/components/Gap.tsx`
  - `src/index.css`
- Issues encountered:
  - Windows PowerShell `| cat` caused errors; avoided piping and ran Vite directly.
  - Initial 404s from dev server due to process lifecycle; resolved with clean foreground/background starts.
- Current status:
  - Dev server running at `http://localhost:5173/` with HMR; mobile emulation works via Chrome device toolbar.
  - Sections render without horizontal overflow; hero fills safe viewport on iOS/Android.
- Next steps:
  - Full click‑through QA of mobile menu links and anchor offsets across breakpoints.
  - Verify GitHub Pages deploy still uses `target: 'es2020'` (vite.config.ts already compliant).

### Deployment — 2025-09-23 (Mobile polish)

### Update — 2025-09-23 (Team profiles, footer anchors, and dev-only testing)

- Changes (dev and prod-safe UI polish):
  - Team section: larger portraits, two-line clamp on name/role, founders listed first.
  - Role titles shortened and normalized to hedge-fund style.
  - Education lines normalized with short forms (Ivey/Western, Waterloo, Laurier, UC Davis, USTC).
  - Metrics updated: Universities Represented → 5; Sectors Worked (Collective) → 10.
  - Footer anchors now use the same precise header-offset scrolling as top navigation.
  - Modal logos sized to match portrait width across breakpoints.
- Dev-only (not visible in production):
  - Added Zilong Bai test profile with UC Davis and USTC logos; profile currently hidden from render.
  - Local-only copy adjustments for advisory language.
- Notes:
  - No changes to `vite.config.ts` target; remains 'es2020'.
  - Ready to deploy; cache-busting handled by Vite asset hashes.
