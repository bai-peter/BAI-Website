- Make Core Systems cards fully opaque

- Changes:
  - Set global `.group.border.rounded-lg` background to fully opaque `bg-card`.
  - Updated Core Systems cards to use `bg-card` (no alpha) with solid hover.
- Files modified:
  - `src/index.css`
  - `src/components/TechnologyPlatform.tsx`

- Fix team card expansion to be per-card, not global

- Changes:
  - Replaced single `expandedCard` state with a `Set<number>` `expandedCards` to track multiple open cards independently.
  - Updated toggle logic and UI conditions accordingly.
- Files modified:
  - `src/components/FoundersInSearch.tsx`

- Adjust font sizing and contrast in Technology & Infrastructure → Core Systems cards

- Changes:
  - Increased title to `text-xl md:text-2xl`, body to `text-base md:text-lg` for readability.
  - Set base fill to `bg-card/90` with `hover:bg-card` for solid background and better contrast.
  - Kept borders consistent with `border border-border`.
- Files modified:
  - `src/components/TechnologyPlatform.tsx`

## 2025-09-22 — Improve card background opacity for readability

- Changes:
  - Increased default opacity for outlined cards so background within borders is less transparent and text is more readable.
  - Removed translucency on `.card-interactive` hover that previously reduced contrast.
- Technical details:
  - Edited `src/index.css`:
    - Removed `hover:bg-muted/20` from `.card-interactive`.
    - Added base fill for outlined group cards: `.group.border.rounded-lg { background-color: hsl(var(--card) / 0.9); }` and solid on hover.
- Files modified:
  - `src/index.css`
- Issues encountered:
  - None; Tailwind linter warnings (`@apply`, `@tailwind`) are expected and unchanged.
- Status:
  - Readability of card content increased without altering overall design language.
- Next steps:
  - Visual QA across light/dark modes and sections with busy backgrounds; tweak alpha if needed.
  - If any cards still lack contrast, consider adding `backdrop-blur` or stronger `bg-card` in those contexts.

## 2025-09-22

- Updated animated nodes to follow geometric grid globally and removed them from Hero to keep the video layer clean and unobstructed.
- Fixed scroll offset across `Index.tsx`, `Header.tsx`, and `Footer.tsx` to 120px to eliminate the video sliver when navigating to sections (e.g., "Our Approach").
- Normalized spacing util classes: reduced `section-spacing` and `content-spacing` for better balance; adjusted Hero internal spacing.
- Standardized typography scale (reduced h1–h3, paragraphs, and taglines) for institutional readability.
- Refined Team section layout: tightened stats spacing, compact card layout, consistent text sizes.
- Increased the About section logo size within "Key Metrics" (container to `w-28 h-28`, logo `w-20`).
- Verified Vite build target remains `es2020` for GitHub Pages MIME compatibility.
 - Converted section background layers (geometric patterns + nodes) to fixed-position so they remain stationary during scroll across all sections; disabled pointer events to avoid interaction issues.
 - Replaced geometric backgrounds and nodes with a fixed far-background SVG chart (`BackgroundChart.tsx`) that renders a randomized upward-biased line with a glowing pulse. Applied to all sections except Hero. Removed prior floating nodes CSS.
 - Restored visibility of randomized line animation by raising `.background-layer` stacking context (z-index from -10 to 0) while keeping `pointer-events: none` to avoid blocking interactions.
 - Added fixed `.pulse-layer` to render glowing heads above content; ensured hidden over Hero only.
 - Converted single line to multiple independently seeded lines with slower motion; smoothed volatility and reduced step rate; pulses now visibly lead the lines across sections including `#what-we-do`.
 - Replaced dot heads with neon leading segment; applied `mix-blend-mode: screen` and glow to ensure visibility on white sections without overpowering dark ones; ensured Hero sits above pulses (no overlay on video).
 - Added fade-out on completion and staggered spawning so new lines begin before previous complete; biased endpoints to land mid-to-top right for visually pleasing terminations.
 - Removed endpoint targeting; lines now wander randomly with upward bias, still fading out at completion and spawning successors before completion for continuous flow.
 - Slowed fade-out (opacity decays gently) and applied opacity to both trail and neon head so the entire line visibly fades.
 - Increased max concurrent lines to 10 with sequential, randomized cooldown spawns (no bursts); each line fades independently.
 - Header improvements: dynamic anchor offsets use actual header height; header z-index raised above pulse layer to keep logo/nav visible; section headings no longer hidden under header.
 - Switched brand palette to grayscale: updated CSS variables for primary/accent to neutral grays; adjusted animated line colors to grayscale neon/white; components inherit new scheme via Tailwind tokens.
- Deployed latest changes to GitHub Pages (main). Verified `vite.config.ts` target is `es2020` to avoid MIME issues. Expect propagation within a few minutes.
 - Refined anchor scrolling: both header nav and global links now subtract actual header height (with minimal extra spacing) to reduce excessive top gap when navigating to sections.
 - Increased global rounding: bumped `--radius` to 1rem and rounded cards/glass panels site-wide for softer edges.

Files modified:
- `src/components/Hero.tsx`
- `src/components/About.tsx`
- `src/components/FoundersInSearch.tsx`
- `src/components/Manifesto.tsx`
- `src/components/TechnologyPlatform.tsx`
- `src/components/Community.tsx`
- `src/pages/Index.tsx`
- `src/components/Header.tsx`
- `src/components/Footer.tsx`
- `src/index.css`

Issues addressed:
- Floating nodes appearing over video; moved off Hero.
- Section scroll landing offset showing video sliver; increased offset.
- Excessive spacing and oversized type leading to cramped/uneven layout.

Status:
- Local dev server running on http://localhost:8080/ with HMR.

Next steps:
- Fine-tune node path randomness along grid; consider multi-path variants.
- QA on multiple screen sizes; adjust offsets for mobile header height if needed.
- Prepare for deploy; confirm assets and favicon behavior post-build.
